# üß≠ Day 1 ‚Äî AWS KMS Theory and Architecture  
_A foundation in managed cryptography for the cloud architect._

## 1Ô∏è‚É£  The Big Idea ‚Äî ‚ÄúLocks, Keys & Trust‚Äù

Imagine every object in the cloud as a **treasure chest**.  
When you store it (in S3 or EBS), AWS wraps it with a **lock**.  
But who owns the **master key**?  
‚Üí **You do**, through **AWS Key Management Service (KMS).**

KMS keeps the **Key Encryption Keys (KEKs)** sealed in a hardware vault (HSM).  
It issues **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)** to your workloads, uses them to lock the data, then destroys them.  
The master key never leaves the vault.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Hierarchy and Terminology
Layer	Purpose	Lifetime	Example
CMK (Customer Managed Key)	Root KEK stored in HSM	Long-term	alias/masterclass-cmk
DEK (Data Encryption Key)	Encrypts actual data	Ephemeral	Random AES-256
Envelope Encryption	Wrap DEK with CMK	Per object	Used in SSE-KMS
Grants & Policies	Who can use the key	Continuous	IAM & KMS grant docs

3Ô∏è‚É£ Shared Responsibility View
AWS KMS	You (the customer)
Operates HSM fleet, FIPS 140-2 L3 validated	Create and manage CMKs, aliases
Secure storage of key material	Define IAM/KMS policies and grants
Key rotation infrastructure	Choose rotation intervals
Regional replication control	Determine cross-region strategy

4Ô∏è‚É£ Common Integration Patterns
S3 SSE-KMS ‚Äî Encrypt each object with a DEK wrapped by your CMK

EBS Default Encryption ‚Äî All volumes use the CMK automatically

RDS / Secrets Manager / Lambda ‚Äî Services invoke KMS API to encrypt data before storage

CloudTrail + CloudWatch ‚Äî Track GenerateDataKey, Decrypt, DisableKey events

6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Practices Checklist
 Use CMKs instead of AWS-managed keys for sensitive data

 Enable automatic rotation (every 365 days)

 Restrict access with kms:ViaService and kms:EncryptionContext

 Audit with CloudTrail and AWS Config

 Prefer envelope encryption over client-side DIY

7Ô∏è‚É£ Mini-Case Study
Scenario: You run a healthcare SaaS storing images in S3.
Requirement: HIPAA encryption and key rotation.
Solution:

Create alias/hipaa-cmk in KMS.

Enable S3 bucket SSE-KMS with that alias.

Schedule rotation.

Forward CloudTrail logs to Security Hub.

Result: Full data at-rest encryption with centralized auditing.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Reflection & Quiz
What‚Äôs the difference between SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS?

Why can‚Äôt you download the CMK material even as root?

What events prove KMS use in CloudTrail?

How does envelope encryption help with key rotation?

How would you use kms:EncryptionContext for fine-grained control?
