## üéØ Objectives
- Understand **multi-layer envelope encryption**
- Map **RBAC** to encryption roles across AWS, Azure, and GCP
- Practice **rotation and re-wrapping** of envelope keys
- Visualize the ‚Äúkey within key‚Äù architecture

## üß† Analogy ‚Äî *‚ÄúThe Diplomatic Pouch‚Äù*
Think of your data as a message carried in a **sealed pouch**.  
Inside it are **smaller envelopes**, each re-sealed by a trusted authority (AWS ‚Üí Azure ‚Üí GCP).  
Each courier can read its own label but cannot open the pouch itself.

## üß© Envelope Encryption Layers
| Layer | Key | Managed By | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|-------------|
| üîê **Data Key (DEK)** | AES-256 | Application | Encrypts data locally |
| üß± **Envelope Key (EDK)** | CMK | Cloud KMS | Encrypts the DEK |
| üè¶ **Master Key (Root)** | HSM / BYOK | Org Security | Wraps the EDK for cross-cloud use |

üß∞ RBAC Alignment per Cloud

Cloud	    Role	                         Scope	                    Notes

AWS         kms:Encrypt, kms:Decrypt,            CMK policy + IAM           Fine-grained grants for EC2/Lambda
              kms:GenerateDataKey

Azure       Vault Crypto User /                   Data plane                RBAC must be enabled on vault

üßæ Policy Mapping Example

AWS CMK Policy Snippet

{
 "Sid": "AllowLambdaEncryption",
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Principal": {"Service": "lambda.amazonaws.com"},
 "Action": ["kms:Encrypt","kms:Decrypt","kms:GenerateDataKey"],
 "Resource": "*"
}

Azure Vault Role Assignment

az role assignment create \
 --assignee "<managed_identity_id>" \
 --role "Key Vault Crypto User" \
 --scope "/subscriptions/<subid>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/<vault>"

GCP IAM Binding

gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding cmek-envelopes \
 --keyring global-secure --location=us-central1 \
 --member "serviceAccount:encryption-svc@caramel-pager-470614-d1.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
 --role roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter

üîÅ Key Rotation Chain

Rotate the root key (HSM / BYOK).

Rewrap all envelopes (EDKs) under new root.

Data remains untouched; only key wrappers change.

Verify audit logs in each cloud.

üßÆ Compliance Alignment
Framework	Requirement	Feature
NIST 800-57	Key hierarchy separation	DEK ‚â† CMK ‚â† HSM root
ISO 27001 A.10	Cryptographic control	RBAC + rotation
PCI DSS 3.6	Key rotation and storage	Envelope model supports
üß≠ Summary

Envelope encryption with RBAC is the governance layer of cloud crypto ‚Äî each service only decrypts its layer, and every unwrap is audited.
This ensures least privilege and traceability across AWS, Azure, and GCP.
